10 Meter Walk Test
===========================================================================
**Learn More**: https://bit.ly/2tDOhfL

## A tool for measuring the progress of patients with partial mobility impairment.
#### Setting Up:
![](./md_images/10m.png)
  
  Measure and mark a 10-meter walkway

  Add a marker at 2-meter
  
  Add a marker at 8-meter

#### Administer instructions:
  The individual walks without assistance for 10 meters, with the time measured for the intermediate 6 meters to allow for acceleration and deceleration. 
  Assistive devices may be used, but must be kept consistent and documented for each test. 
  Start timing when the toes pass the 2 meter mark.
  Stop timing when the toes pass the 8 meter mark.
  Can be tested at either preferred walking speed **(NORMAL)** or maximum walking speed **(FAST)**.
  (ensure to select the right choice in the app, which was tested)                  
  After performing three trials, the app will calculate the average of three trials and auto generate a patient result snippet that you can cut and paste into their **EMR**, Electronic Medical Record.


### Patient Instructions:
![](./md_images/prosthetic.png)
##### Normal comfortable speed trial:
 “I will say ready, set, go. When I say go, walk at your comfortable speed until I say  stop”
      (perform 3x and generate result)
##### Maximum speed trials:
 “I will say ready, set, go. When I say go, walk as fast as you safely can until I say stop”
     (perform 3x and generate result)
